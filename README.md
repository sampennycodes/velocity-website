# Velocity Marketing Website

A marketing website for Velocity Marketing built with Astro.

## Contact Form with Resend âœ…

The contact form is now **FULLY INTEGRATED with Resend** and will actually send emails! This uses Astro's built-in API routes with the Vercel adapter for both local development and production deployment.

### Setup Instructions:

1. **Get Your Resend API Key**
   - Sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com)
   - Verify your domain in the Resend dashboard
   - Create an API key

2. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Add the following variables to your existing `.env` file:
     ```
     RESEND_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
     SEND_EMAIL_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com
     ```
   - Use your verified domain for `SEND_EMAIL_FROM`

3. **Local Development**
   - Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
   - The contact form will work locally with your Resend API key

4. **Vercel Deployment**
   - The project is configured with `@astrojs/vercel` adapter
   - Add your environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
     - Go to your project settings â†’ Environment Variables
     - Add `RESEND_API_KEY` and `SEND_EMAIL_FROM`
   - Deploy with `vercel --prod` or push to your connected Git repository

5. **Test the Contact Form**
   - Fill out and submit the contact form
   - Check that emails are being sent to mike@velocitymarketing.com.au

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Cannot find module" errors in Vercel**
   - Ensure you're using `output: 'server'` in `astro.config.mjs`
   - Verify the `@astrojs/vercel` adapter is properly configured
   - Check that your environment variables are set in Vercel dashboard

2. **Contact form not sending emails**
   - Verify your `RESEND_API_KEY` is correct
   - Ensure `SEND_EMAIL_FROM` uses a verified domain in Resend
   - Check Vercel function logs for any API errors

3. **Build errors**
   - Run `npm run build` locally to catch issues before deployment
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed with `npm install`

### Environment Variables in Vercel:
- Go to your Vercel project dashboard
- Navigate to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
- Add:
  - `RESEND_API_KEY` = your actual Resend API key
  - `SEND_EMAIL_FROM` = your verified domain (e.g., noreply@yourdomain.com)
