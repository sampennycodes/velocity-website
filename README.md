# Velocity Marketing Website

A marketing website for Velocity Marketing built with Astro.

## Contact Form with Resend âœ…

The contact form is now **FULLY INTEGRATED with Resend** and will actually send emails! This uses Astro's built-in API routes with the Node adapter for both local development and production.

### Setup Instructions:

1. **Get Your Resend API Key**
   - Sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com)
   - Verify your domain in the Resend dashboard
   - Create an API key

2. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Add the following variables to your existing `.env` file:
     ```
     RESEND_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
     SEND_EMAIL_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com
     ```
   - Use your verified domain for `SEND_EMAIL_FROM`

3. **Local Development**
   - Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
   - The contact form will work locally with your Resend API key

4. **Production Deployment**
   - Deploy to any Node.js hosting service (Vercel, Netlify, Railway, etc.)
   - Add your environment variables to your hosting platform
   - The contact form will work in production

5. **Test the Contact Form**
   - Fill out and submit the contact form
   - Check that emails are being sent to mike@velocitymarketing.com.au
